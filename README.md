# Excel_crowdfunding_analysis

For this project, a excel database containing information including project name, category, funding goal, funding amount raised, and number of backers for a sample of 1,000 crowdfunding projects. The purpose of the analysis was to uncover any hidden trends that could be duplicated for future projects to increase their potential for success.

Before analysis could begin, the data was cleaned to remove duplicates, irrelevant information, etc, using conditional formatting. A graded color scale was used to highlight the funding perctages and a multi-tiered color range to highlight the outcome of each project. This made high level identification easier for the viewer.

Visualizations were then created to highlight key analysis points:
